# B+ Tree with Variable Data

A modern, high-performance B+ Tree implementation in C++ designed as a drop-in replacement for `std::map`. This data structure is optimized for tight memory control and maximizes throughput, delivering a threefold increase in performance compared to the standard library. Comprehensive testing is ensured through robust `doctest` routines.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Achieves significant speed improvements over traditional `std::map` through efficient design and implementation.
- **Tight Memory Control**: Minimizes memory overhead while maintaining scalability.
- **Variable Data Support**: Flexibly handles various data types for diverse applications.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified using extensive `doctest` cases for reliability and accuracy.

## Use Cases

- High-throughput systems requiring efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Applications needing a lightweight, fast alternative to `std::map`.
- Projects where memory efficiency is critical without compromising performance.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and integrate the B+ Tree implementation into your project as a replacement for `std::map`. Detailed examples and usage instructions are provided in the documentation.
